# Business Battles!

Business Battles is a mobile role-playing game (RPG) where users scan special QR codes to battle and earn non-fungible token (NFT) creatures.
These NFTs are unique to each business and get harder and harder to catch as more people do!

User goes into a business (we will start with restaurants) and scans a QR code found on their receipt (or another place restaurant chooses)
QR code initiates a battle
User defeats creature => receives NFT in wallet
User loses ⇒ Do not get creature; Buy at auction (“one and done”)
Battle difficulty increases as more users win against and capture the NFT creature

Here is how it works:

In deploying a Scilla smart contract, we figured we would stick with a simple example of just deploying a contract that identifies battles state. In other words, did this wallet address actually win the battle and earn the NFT?

In the future, we hope to implement auction functionalities for those early adopters to sell their creatures on a marketplace.
